# STT-Breton-language
This project focuses on develloping a speech-to-text system for Breton language, a Celtic regional language spoken in France. As a low ressource language, Breton lacks tools and data for speech recogniztion. Our goal is to explore existing models and efficient techniques for Speech-to-Text applications, collect a substantial amount of data, and adapt a performant STT system tailored to the Breton language.
