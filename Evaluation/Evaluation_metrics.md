# Evaluation Metrics :
In order to evaluate speech-To-Text models, several evaluation metrics are commonly used, among them **WER ( word error rate )** and **CER ( character error rate )** which are the most widely adopted measures of accuracy.
## WER :
It calculates the percentage of words in a system's output that differ from a human-transcribed reference text. Errors can be substitutions (a wrong word), deletions (a word is missed), or insertions (an extra word is added). A lower WER indicates better performance.
## CER :
It calculates the percentage of characters in a system's output that differ from a human-transcribed reference text. Errors can be substitutions (a wrong character), deletions (a character is missed), or insertions (an extra character is added). A lower CER indicates better performance.
