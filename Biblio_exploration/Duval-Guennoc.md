# Duval-Guennoc 2022-present - Anaouder
## Anaouder : a VOSK model for the Breton language.
* It is a toolbox in python available online designed specifically
for Speech-To-Text recognization.
* It was made for generating transcriptions from a video or an audio in Breton
with taking in concideration Capital letters ( for proper nouns )
and number, dates, quantities ... etc.
* The model is trained on 60 hours of Speech, tho it doesn't offer
a very high performance.
