# Kaldi : an Open-Source Toolkit for Speech recognition
Kaldi is a complex **low-level** toolkit that offers a collection of tools such as : audio processing and feature extraction. It provides the core algorithm to build speech-to-text systems from scratch.
* Kaldi supports **TDNN architecture** : a type of neural network designed specifically for processing temporal data like audio or speech.
* Gweltaz has trained several Vosk speech recognition models using **Kaldi**. The most recent model is:
  - Name : "vosk-model-br-25.02"
  - Version : 10
  - Type : Vosk
  - Url : "https://github.com/gweltou/patromou/raw/refs/heads/main/vosk-model-br-25.02.zip"
