## Common Voice
### What is Common Voice?
* Common Voice is a famous project made by Mozilla in 2019, it represents a 
large dataset of voice recordings in many languages including low
ressources or endangered languages such as Breton.
* This dataset is designed for scientific researches and it may help
for building Speech-To-Text models specially for the language we are
interested in : Breton.
* The advantage of Common Voice is that it doesnt only focus on widely
spoken languages ( such as English or French ), it also includes many
other languages with a limited number of speakers.
### Exploring Breton Speech Resources within Common Voice :
Breton language is one of the languages included in the Mozilla Common Voice, By exploring the Breton part of the dataset, I found that it provides :
* A different versions of Breton voice recordings collection with
the latest version is the largest and most diversed one.
* Some segments from the original dataset that can be used for
testing models on a small amounts of data before using the large
dataset.
* The latest version of Breton daatset is called : Common Voice Corpus 21.0
