# Banque Sonore des Dialectes Bretons :
The Breton Dialects Sound Archive is a project for making available on the Internet a wide range of recordings of traditional Breton-speakers made over the past dozen years or so.

The purpose of these online archives, compiled by a team of volonteer collectors all keen on studying the language and traditions of Breton-speaking Brittany, is to share with the broad public the wealth and diversity of this important cultural heritage.
