# What is Whisper?
* It is an Automatic Speech Recognition system develloped by OpenAI. It was trained on a large dataset in multiple languages ( 680,000 hours of data ).
* Whisper stands out as a best-in-class ASR system due to its exceptional base accuracy and performance in handling diverse languages. Its adaptability to challenging acoustic conditions, i.e. noisy and multilingual audio, sets it apart from other speech recognition systems. According to the Open ASR Leaderboard, its average word error rate is 8.06%, i.e. it is 92% accurate by default. [source](https://www.gladia.io/blog/what-is-openai-whisper)
* Whisper is trained on several language including Breton, and many other low-ressource languages.

## Whisper models
There are six model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model. The relative speeds below are measured by transcribing English speech on a A100, and the real-world speed may vary significantly depending on many factors including the language, the speaking speed, and the available hardware.
